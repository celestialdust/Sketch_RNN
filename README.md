# SketchRNN Project

Welcome to the SketchRNN Project! This repository is designed for beginners in machine learning who wish to apply Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in practice, following the theoretical learning phase. Utilizing the QuickDraw dataset from TensorFlow's SketchRNN tutorial, this project provides a hands-on approach to understanding and implementing RNNs for sketch classification.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Keras

Ensure you have the above Python packages installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib keras
```
## Dataset

The project uses the QuickDraw dataset, available directly through TensorFlow's datasets. This dataset comprises millions of doodles across hundreds of categories, ideal for practicing machine learning models.

## Usage

To get started with the SketchRNN project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to begin exploring and training the RNN models on the QuickDraw dataset.
